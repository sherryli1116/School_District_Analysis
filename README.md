## Overview
A school board wanted us to help find the academic dishonesty in its current student file. In specific, the reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth grades have been altered. The school board does not know the full extent of the academic dishonesty , and in order to uphold state testing standard, it has asked us to to replace the math and reading scores with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact.
